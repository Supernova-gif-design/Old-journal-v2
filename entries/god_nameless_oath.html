<h1>The Nameless Oath</h1>
<p>The Sky Kingdom ties its bridges with lightning; the knots are prayers.</p>
<p>Ink stains the margin where the Chronicler paused, as if weighing a cost only he could see.</p>
<p>Giants carve prophecies into cliff-face scriptâ€”each rune big as a wagon door.</p>
<p>Names are doors. Some you should not open.</p>
