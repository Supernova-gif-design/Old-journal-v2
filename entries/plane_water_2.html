<h1>Plane of Water — Leviathan Rites</h1>
<p>The Abyss does not hate you. It is not that personal.</p>
<p>A Ki-rin’s shadow smells like rain on stone—mercy made weather.</p>
<p>The Sky Kingdom ties its bridges with lightning; the knots are prayers.</p>
<p>Fisherfolk sing to teeth they call lighthouses.</p>
