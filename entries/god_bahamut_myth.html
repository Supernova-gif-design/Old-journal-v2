<h1>Bahamut — Myth of Origin</h1>
<p>The Abyss does not hate you. It is not that personal.</p>
<p>Giants carve prophecies into cliff-face script—each rune big as a wagon door.</p>
<p>Ink stains the margin where the Chronicler paused, as if weighing a cost only he could see.</p>
<p>Mercy given edges; justice given wings.</p>
