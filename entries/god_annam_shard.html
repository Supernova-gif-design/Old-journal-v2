<h1>Annam — Shard of the All-Father</h1>
<p>Giants carve prophecies into cliff-face script—each rune big as a wagon door.</p>
<p>The Sky Kingdom ties its bridges with lightning; the knots are prayers.</p>
<p>Sailors whisper that some storms wear crowns; those are the ones that remember names.</p>
<p>A broken thunderbolt kept in a silk bag.</p>
