<h1>Plane of Earth — Annam’s Silence</h1>
<p>Ink stains the margin where the Chronicler paused, as if weighing a cost only he could see.</p>
<p>The Sky Kingdom ties its bridges with lightning; the knots are prayers.</p>
<p>Sailors whisper that some storms wear crowns; those are the ones that remember names.</p>
<p>A throne awaits a father who forgot to return.</p>
