<h1>Plane of Air — Ki-rin Ascension Festival</h1>
<p>Ink stains the margin where the Chronicler paused, as if weighing a cost only he could see.</p>
<p>They say Bahamut’s breath can bless or burn, depending on how steady your eye can hold his.</p>
<p>The Sky Kingdom ties its bridges with lightning; the knots are prayers.</p>
<p>Children paint storm-motes and release them like lanterns.</p>
