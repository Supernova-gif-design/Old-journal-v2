<h1>Chorus of Teeth</h1>
<p>In the City of Brass, oaths are hammered as links of chain; to break one is to swallow fire.</p>
<p>The Abyss does not hate you. It is not that personal.</p>
<p>They say Bahamutâ€™s breath can bless or burn, depending on how steady your eye can hold his.</p>
<p>A storm made of mouths that sing wrong.</p>
