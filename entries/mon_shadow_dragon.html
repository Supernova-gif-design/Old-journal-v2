<h1>Shadow Dragon â€” Lullaby Eater</h1>
<p>In the City of Brass, oaths are hammered as links of chain; to break one is to swallow fire.</p>
<p>The Sky Kingdom ties its bridges with lightning; the knots are prayers.</p>
<p>Ink stains the margin where the Chronicler paused, as if weighing a cost only he could see.</p>
<p>Dreams with scales.</p>
