<h1>Frostwind Virago</h1>
<p>In the City of Brass, oaths are hammered as links of chain; to break one is to swallow fire.</p>
<p>Giants carve prophecies into cliff-face scriptâ€”each rune big as a wagon door.</p>
<p>Sailors whisper that some storms wear crowns; those are the ones that remember names.</p>
<p>A blizzard with talons.</p>
