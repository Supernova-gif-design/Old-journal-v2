<h1>Astrael — Quiet Corruption</h1>
<p>Somewhere in the Astral, a greenhouse grows seedlings of constellations beneath crystal domes.</p>
<p>Giants carve prophecies into cliff-face script—each rune big as a wagon door.</p>
<p>The Abyss does not hate you. It is not that personal.</p>
<p>Not every wound bleeds.</p>
