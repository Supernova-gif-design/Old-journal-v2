<h1>Fractured Herald</h1>
<p>A Ki-rin’s shadow smells like rain on stone—mercy made weather.</p>
<p>The Feywild feels like a promise—and like all promises, its teeth are hidden behind a smile.</p>
<p>In the City of Brass, oaths are hammered as links of chain; to break one is to swallow fire.</p>
<p>Halo like a broken wheel.</p>
