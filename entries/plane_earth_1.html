<h1>Plane of Earth — Steps of Jotunheim</h1>
<p>A Ki-rin’s shadow smells like rain on stone—mercy made weather.</p>
<p>Sailors whisper that some storms wear crowns; those are the ones that remember names.</p>
<p>Giants carve prophecies into cliff-face script—each rune big as a wagon door.</p>
<p>Stone remembers every footprint for a thousand years.</p>
