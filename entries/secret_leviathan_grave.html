<h1>Secret — Grave of the First Leviathan</h1>
<p>Somewhere in the Astral, a greenhouse grows seedlings of constellations beneath crystal domes.</p>
<p>In the City of Brass, oaths are hammered as links of chain; to break one is to swallow fire.</p>
<p>A Ki-rin’s shadow smells like rain on stone—mercy made weather.</p>
<p>Ribcage island; teeth as lighthouses.</p>
