<h1>Demogorgon — Prince of Madness</h1>
<p>A Ki-rin’s shadow smells like rain on stone—mercy made weather.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the Astral, a greenhouse grows seedlings of constellations beneath crystal domes.</p>
<p>The Feywild feels like a promise—and like all promises, its teeth are hidden behind a smile.</p>
<p>Two minds, one hunger.</p>
