<h1>Plane of Water — The Tidal Library</h1>
<p>A Ki-rin’s shadow smells like rain on stone—mercy made weather.</p>
<p>Ink stains the margin where the Chronicler paused, as if weighing a cost only he could see.</p>
<p>Sailors whisper that some storms wear crowns; those are the ones that remember names.</p>
<p>Books hang on ropes; pages dry in moonwind.</p>
